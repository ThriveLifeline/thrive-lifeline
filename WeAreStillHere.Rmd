## Diem (he/they)

Growing up, it was hard not to feel perpetually stuck in the middle. Neither boy nor girl, neither gay nor straight, neither completely Westernized nor Indian. I lamented being a floater in search of solid ground within social groups. It was only a matter of time before the differences were irreconcilable — either between me and the group, or between me and the 'me' people thought me to be. I was either too close to the stereotype or not stereotypical enough: too confident in my queerness for Texas but not enough for Toronto.

I spent so long trying to figure out which box I fit into that I neglected myself. The energy I put into making sure I didn't alienate myself from newspaper staffs, marching band members, classmates, and extended family zapped me of the strength I needed to find myself in the mess of my anxieties and others' expectations. The worst part was that I ended up feeling alienated anyway because you can't feel cared for by others if the person they are caring for is not 'you'. 

It was only when I fully embraced my queerness, my transness, and my background that I felt able to form genuine connections. It was only when I learned to reserve my energy for those who energize and support me that I stopped always feeling alone. Of course, not everything is solved, but I'm an Indian, queer trans guy medically transitioning with the support of my family and friends — and I'm the happiest I've been in years.

## Colt (she/her)

My name is Colt. I’m a cis, ethnically Jewish sapphic queer woman, and I detransitioned as trans person. I know detransitioning has historically been stigmatized but I want to help change the narrative. I believe we all deserve to be who we are and if that means exploring your gender and/or sexuality, that is totally ok.

I grew up in the south, and I wasn’t getting the support I needed. I had the privilege to travel all over the US to explore my truth. Now that I’m in my 30’s, I feel happy and free.

## Delta (they/them)

I’ve always felt like I was on the sidelines. I was a neurodivergent child who did not fit in at school, and I first developed a chronic illness at age 11. I first realized I was queer when I was 13. I struggled to make friends, struggled to find any other child who could possibly understand. But now I’m in college, and those things that once made me an outcast and made me fear I’d never get through life independently make me strong. They have given me community and have allowed me to build community. I’m proud to be
disabled, neurodivergent, and queer. Not because those things make my life easy. But because of the
shared strength I have with my community.

## Cyrus (he/they/any)

A stark white, serene, business-y virtual background. Blocking out the ever-changing chaos, depression
cave scenery that surrounds me. I haven’t left my house alone in months. I’m too scared.

School was my escape, since graduating uni last year, work has become my escape. And my lifeline. My
structure. My source of income. My success and my friends and family’s pride. I’ve gone corporate. Not very Berkeley of me!

But we deserve to be everywhere. In conference rooms and board rooms too. But I know who I am and
what I need to be here.

I have gotten 2 new gender neutral bathrooms opened at my company in my state. We went from 1 trucker
bathroom in Shipping and Deliveries in the basement to 3 gender neutral bathrooms in the state of
California, with blueprints being drawn for more in another office.

We should be able to be corporate. We should have access. One bathroom in the state? Of California? Of
the second largest tech company in the world? Is unacceptable.

Queer, trans, nonbinary, mixed ethnicity, immigrant parents, disowned, no financial support, physically
disabled, neurodivergent, abuse survivor, mental illnesses, takes meds. What box don’t I check?

8 scholarships to get through college.

6 figure earner at 20 fresh out of college.

I beat the odds- and now I’m paving a trail for others to do the same. Until it isn’t beating the odds, and
success and access are our norm.
