## Diem (he/they)

Growing up, it was hard not to feel perpetually stuck in the middle. Neither boy nor girl, neither gay nor straight, neither completely Westernized nor Indian. I lamented being a floater in search of solid ground within social groups. It was only a matter of time before the differences were irreconcilable — either between me and the group, or between me and the 'me' people thought me to be. I was either too close to the stereotype or not stereotypical enough: too confident in my queerness for Texas but not enough for Toronto.

I spent so long trying to figure out which box I fit into that I neglected myself. The energy I put into making sure I didn't alienate myself from newspaper staffs, marching band members, classmates, and extended family zapped me of the strength I needed to find myself in the mess of my anxieties and others' expectations. The worst part was that I ended up feeling alienated anyway because you can't feel cared for by others if the person they are caring for is not 'you'. 

It was only when I fully embraced my queerness, my transness, and my background that I felt able to form genuine connections. It was only when I learned to reserve my energy for those who energize and support me that I stopped always feeling alone. Of course, not everything is solved, but I'm an Indian, queer trans guy medically transitioning with the support of my family and friends — and I'm the happiest I've been in years.
