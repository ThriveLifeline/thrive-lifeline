## Diem (he/they)

Growing up, it was hard not to feel perpetually stuck in the middle. Neither boy nor girl, neither gay nor straight, neither completely Westernized nor Indian. I lamented being a floater in search of solid ground within social groups. It was only a matter of time before the differences were irreconcilable — either between me and the group, or between me and the 'me' people thought me to be. I was either too close to the stereotype or not stereotypical enough: too confident in my queerness for Texas but not enough for Toronto.

I spent so long trying to figure out which box I fit into that I neglected myself. The energy I put into making sure I didn't alienate myself from newspaper staffs, marching band members, classmates, and extended family zapped me of the strength I needed to find myself in the mess of my anxieties and others' expectations. The worst part was that I ended up feeling alienated anyway because you can't feel cared for by others if the person they are caring for is not 'you'. 

It was only when I fully embraced my queerness, my transness, and my background that I felt able to form genuine connections. It was only when I learned to reserve my energy for those who energize and support me that I stopped always feeling alone. Of course, not everything is solved, but I'm an Indian, queer trans guy medically transitioning with the support of my family and friends — and I'm the happiest I've been in years.

## Colt (she/her)

My name is Colt. I’m a cis, ethnically Jewish sapphic queer woman, and I detransitioned as trans person. I know detransitioning has historically been stigmatized but I want to help change the narrative. I believe we all deserve to be who we are and if that means exploring your gender and/or sexuality, that is totally ok.

I grew up in the south, and I wasn’t getting the support I needed. I had the privilege to travel all over the US to explore my truth. Now that I’m in my 30’s, I feel happy and free.

## Delta (they/them)

I’ve always felt like I was on the sidelines. I was a neurodivergent child who did not fit in at school, and I first developed a chronic illness at age 11. I first realized I was queer when I was 13. I struggled to make friends, struggled to find any other child who could possibly understand. But now I’m in college, and those things that once made me an outcast and made me fear I’d never get through life independently make me strong. They have given me community and have allowed me to build community. I’m proud to be
disabled, neurodivergent, and queer. Not because those things make my life easy. But because of the
shared strength I have with my community.

## Cyrus (he/they/any)

A stark white, serene, business-y virtual background. Blocking out the ever-changing chaos, depression
cave scenery that surrounds me. I haven’t left my house alone in months. I’m too scared.

School was my escape, since graduating uni last year, work has become my escape. And my lifeline. My
structure. My source of income. My success and my friends and family’s pride. I’ve gone corporate. Not very Berkeley of me!

But we deserve to be everywhere. In conference rooms and board rooms too. But I know who I am and
what I need to be here.

I have gotten 2 new gender neutral bathrooms opened at my company in my state. We went from 1 trucker
bathroom in Shipping and Deliveries in the basement to 3 gender neutral bathrooms in the state of
California, with blueprints being drawn for more in another office.

We should be able to be corporate. We should have access. One bathroom in the state? Of California? Of
the second largest tech company in the world? Is unacceptable.

Queer, trans, nonbinary, mixed ethnicity, immigrant parents, disowned, no financial support, physically
disabled, neurodivergent, abuse survivor, mental illnesses, takes meds. What box don’t I check?

8 scholarships to get through college.

6 figure earner at 20 fresh out of college.

I beat the odds- and now I’m paving a trail for others to do the same. Until it isn’t beating the odds, and
success and access are our norm.

## Kels (they/them)

How do I fit my life in 300 words? Unprecedented summarizing! I am a contradictory collection, swarming within scarred, tattooed skin: genre-defying, multitude encompassing, unrelentingly verbose. I've never been one to read a single book at a time / subscribe to binaries / fall in love with just one person. I am, if anything, Queer, àla bell hooks: “the self that is at odds with everything around it... that has to invent and create and find a place to speak and to thrive and to live.” I am a cycle-breaker, a survivor (of abusers aplenty, at many ages / stages; of oppressive systems; of brushes with Death): expected, like so many of us, to achieve endlessly, regardless, and to thank everyone for the opportunity. I am an accumulation of formative experiences: growing up neurodivergent / trans / gay in the Bible Belt, in a multifamily household not unlike “Running with Scissors”, traumas masked by privilege / test scores. Breaking down, running away at 15; the following nightmarish year in residential “treatment” in Utah (enough to cement a calling to “alchemize” what I’d lived through by later supporting and advocating for the most vulnerable / naming such corruptions). Even grown up, in long longed-for NYC, I cycled between grad schools and hospitals: still so “treatment-resistant” that they eventually tried almost 50 electric zaps to my broken brain in all (<b>shockingly</b> electrocution didn’t cure me / mostly left me forgetful, filterless). Last year, increasingly unbearable pain finally culminated in a life-changing Official Diagnosis with an incurable genetic disorder (hEDS)— only 33 years after the first symptoms! This revelation of my long-denied host of illnesses has me processing / raging / grieving the unfathomable impact of medical gaslighting and neglect— all those accusations of hypochondria; malingering, even! It’s been the heartbreaking end of several relationships and chapters of my life: humbling, illuminating, freeing.

## Theo (they/them)

I'm a non-binary transgender person, and the host of a DID system. We also experience depression, anxiety, and complex PTSD. I used to feel like I was too weird for anyone to ever really know me and still like me. Gay, transgender, mentally ill, neurodivergent, multiple. "I just get wierder as people get to know me!" I thought. "There's no way anyone will think I'm worth loving." But now I have people in my life who actually do love and accept me in all my complexity. They celebrate my queerness, my resilience, my uniqueness. I still struggle with depression and anxiety. I still feel lonely. I still experience chronic suicidal ideation (which is common for people complex ptsd), but I know that I don't deserve to suffer. I know that I'm not hard to love. I am good, and I am worthy of love. And so are you.

## The Galaxy (all pronouns)

Collectively we are The Galaxy, a system of parts who make up a whole mind. We have complex Dissociative Identity “Disorder” whose main symptom is identity fragmentation; for us, this condition is our brain’s adaptation to survive many forms of abuse and other traumas throughout our life. Our body is mixed South American Native, and we exist as genderqueer, multicultural, autistic, mad, and physically disabled persons. We depend on our community for financial, emotional, and physical support, and we are strong advocates for the importance of building community care and support networks outside of oppressive institutions. In order to survive, we have been forced to hide the scarier truths of our mental and physical disabilities, such as voice-hearing, self harm addiction, and chronic pain, which especially in conjunction with our racial identity, can and have resulted in severe danger. It is our prayer that one day, nobody should have to hide their disabilities in order to survive, but instead can reveal their support needs to a community where they will be protected.

## Ka&#235;l (they/them)

I am a trans, neurodivergent and mad human studying to work in mental health. Growing up I always felt othered, like my soul was defective and broken and had been sent on this earth by accident, and that everybody could feel it. I went through 9 years of intense bullying which led me to struggle a lot during my teenage years. I got diagnosed with dysthymia + MDD, GAD + panic disorder, anorexia, C-PTSD, and later with BPD and alcohol use disorder, and struggled a lot with suicide.

During my stays in psychiatric wards, I witnessed many devoted members of the staff who treated us like humans with compassion and kindness, and I also witnessed situations where psychiatry was misused to overly drug and restrain patients, and abuse that came from stigma from the practitionners. That shaped my view on how we treat mad individuals in this medical system, especially those from marginalised communities and identities, and I want to do good. On the side apart from my studies, I am learning more about anti-carceral and community-led ways to help, focused on harm reduction, that I want to integrate in my future work.

I am no longer ashamed of my queerness nor my madness. They are integral parts of who I am that don't need to be fixed.

## Yusur (she/her)

Life hurts. I know it does. I know it does because I’ve been there. There are times where I have questioned why, why this life had to be given to me when I felt like a ghost inside. Why was I given this life to live when I selfishly wish I wasn’t here in the first place. These are questions that I have asked myself for years, and though I don’t have an answer to any of them. I recognize that it’s okay to admit that life hurts.

## Nathan (she/her)

From the time I was really young, I knew I didn’t want to be a boy. I constantly asked my family if they would love me if I were a girl and I would play dress up and other typically girly games. Even though I had always knew I didn’t want to be a boy, I really struggled with my identity because I always thought I just had to be a boy since that’s how I was raised and that’s what everyone knew me to be. I finally took a big step in the journey that is my identity and came out as a trans woman. I haven’t told many of my family because I feared that they wouldn’t like me. I know that they would still love me, but I’ve heard them talk negatively about other people’s identities and I’m scared they would talk about me the same way and no longer think of me as their family. Even though I still have a lot of growing to do, I know that I will never let anyone tell me who I am or who they think I should be.
