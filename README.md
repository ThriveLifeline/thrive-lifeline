# R Markdown THRIVE Test README

This is an example website made using RMarkdown.

You can install RStudio Desktop from 
[https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/](https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/).
Within RStudio, you can build a test website and view it locally.

You can learn more about the RMarkdown format from the 
[Rmarkdown website](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/lesson-1.html).

You can open a project wherever the folder containing the website files are 
on your computer. 
Doing this will save the state of the project and what files you had opened.

Modify the Rmd files for the website as needed.
Then, select the `Build` tab (blue rectangle) and then select the 
`Build Website` button (red rectangle).
This will bring up a local preview. 
You can save each file as you go, select `Knit` to rebuild it into the test 
site, or just `Build Website` again.
