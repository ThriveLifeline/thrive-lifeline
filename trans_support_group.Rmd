## What to Expect
A place where you can THRIVE! Come as you are and have a candid conversation with others who share your identities and experiences. You'll be with people who are just people, like you. Our groups are facilitated by trained crisis responders who identify as Trans and Nonbinary and personally understand gaps in affirming mental health resources, community, and relevant resources. We don't have or offer answers; only listen and support. Whoever you are, wherever you are, we're here for you.

<br>

The general support group structure will be:
<ul>
<li> <b>Welcome:</b> Get comfortable in our space, and go over our community guidelines.
<li> <b>Introductions:</b> Who we are, what THRIVE is, what this support group is about.
<li> <b>Discussions:</b> Each group has a theme with facilitated topics and questions. We'll give you the space to discuss these in small groups with facilitators.
<li> <b>Wrap up:</b> We'll introduce TRANS affirmation cards and discuss future support groups and ways to stay connected. 
</ul>

Funding for 2022-2023 TRANS support group meetings was made possible through the generous gift of the Riley's Way foundation through their Call for Kindness Fellowship.
