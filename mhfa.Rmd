## Overview of MHFA

[Mental Health First Aid USA](https://www.mentalhealthfirstaid.org/) (MHFA) is an evidence-based training that teaches participants how to identify, understand and respond to someone who is experiencing a mental health or substance-use challenge

Similar to physical First Aid and CPR, MHFA teaches a 5-step action plan for assisting someone experiencing a mental health or substance use crisis until professional assistance is obtained or the crisis is resolved. MHFA also teaches how to support someone showing warning signs of a mental health or substance use challenge.

This course requires 2 hours of self-paced content followed by 6 hours of instructor-led virtual training. It is valued at $170. No prior experience with mental health conversations or support is needed; the MHFA curriculum is designed to be accessible to anyone.

Sign up to learn how to support others experiencing mental health or substance use challenges, and prove your skills through a nationally accredited certification!

## Sliding scale cost:

THRIVE has discounted the full rate of MHFA tickets to \$95 to support those in our community who need a globally recognized certification. \$95 is the cost for THRIVE to cover our expenses for this workshop. If you agree to pay the recommended price of \$170, then you are supporting the scholarship for another trainee who could not afford to pay our aid rate of \$75*. For every sponsor cost ticket that is purchased, THRIVE will cover the additional expense of the aid cost ticket. We believe that Together We THRIVE: we support each other with wealth, through acts of service, and through community connections, according to whatever we have to give.
