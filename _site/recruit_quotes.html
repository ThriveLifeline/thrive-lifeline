<h1 class="title toc-ignore">In their own words</h1>

</div>


<p>Since Fall 2020, THRIVE has proudly supported 30 volunteer-based
interns, providing high quality crisis response training and
personalized mentorship inside a team of people who affirm them. As
people with intersecting marginalized identities, we personally
understand the barriers that our interns face to gaining professional
experience and being humanized in their workplaces or academic
environments. We’re so proud of the ways that the THRIVE RECRUIT
Internship program has evolved since we first began! Don’t just take our
word for it, though. Read below to learn what our RECRUITs share about
their experiences.</p>
<p><br></p>

<div id="quinn-hehim-2022-cohort" class="section level2">
<h2>Quinn (he/him): 2022 Cohort</h2>
<p><b>What has being a RECRUIT meant to you?</b></p>
<p>It’s been difficult to find ways to get practical experience in
college since COVID-19 started. The RECRUIT internship matters to me
because it gave me a way to get involved and get experience in a field
that doesn’t have a lot of undergraduate opportunities. The RECRUIT
internship has also introduced me to such a wonderful and supportive
community that I’m grateful to be a part of. Everyone on the team brings
valuable and diverse sets of knowledge that make us stronger.</p>
<p><b>Why did you choose the RECRUIT Internship?</b></p>
<p>I was ecstatic to hear about the opportunity to be involved with
THRIVE. It was truly a no-brainer for me to apply for the RECRUIT
internship. I’ve had my fair share of negative experiences with crisis
lines in the past. A lot of the lines that I’ve reached out to were
ill-equipped to support my trans identity and I felt that I couldn’t
share about everything that I was going through in fear that they would
call emergency services on me. One of the main reasons that I decided to
apply for the RECRUIT internship with THRIVE was because of the
no-escalation policy. Another reason that I decided to apply was that
THRIVE truly values and demonstrates that they support diversity and
inclusion.</p>
<p><b>What would you tell potential RECRUIT applicants?</b></p>
<p>I’ve been involved with a lot of volunteer and extracurricular work
during my college career. These experiences have provided me with
numerous skills that have helped me excel in other areas of my life.
However, my RECRUIT internship at THRIVE has given me, by far, the most
rewarding experiences that I ever could have asked for. I feel immensely
fulfilled knowing that I am contributing to giving back to my community
and creating a better world for people to live in. I’ve also gained
leadership, communication, teamwork, and empathy-building skills through
the RECRUIT internship.</p>
<p><b>What is your biggest takeaway as a RECRUIT?</b></p>
<p>Being LGBTQ+ and a college student in the midst of COVID-19 has been
a very isolating experience. But my internship at THRIVE has shown me
that we are never truly alone in this world. I cannot understate the
amount of support that I have gotten since I started my internship. I
have felt supported at every step of the way. My mentor has been a truly
inspirational figure in my life and I’m so grateful for the other
leaders at THRIVE who have guided me through tough moments. It’s really
rewarding to know that you’re molding a space where others don’t have to
fight as hard to stay alive and feel respected.</p>

<p><b>What has being a RECRUIT meant to you?</b></p>
<p>The RECRUIT internship from THRIVE has given me a valuable
opportunity to serve others as a crisis responder, and has provided me
with a unique perspective on day-to-day life. THRIVE matters to me
because I am constantly inspired by its community and overall mission to
support, value, and uplift others.</p>
<p><b>Why did you choose the RECRUIT Internship?</b></p>
<p>I was not initially considering an internship this year, but when the
opportunity to intern with THRIVE was introduced to me, I knew I had to
apply. My main consideration in applying for THRIVE was my interest in a
chance to support groups I can identify with.</p>
<p><b>What would you tell potential RECRUIT applicants?</b></p>
<p>I would suggest someone apply for the RECRUIT internship because it
allows one to grow as an individual, learn to view diverse challenges
and obstacles in a unique way, and most of all, you will create valuable
and lasting connections with the other wonderful members of THRIVE.</p>
<p><b>What is your biggest takeaway as a RECRUIT?</b></p>
<p>The techniques and skills I was taught by THRIVE have definitely been
an impactful part of my experience from the RECRUIT internship. The
skills learned through THRIVE’s training are effective in real-life
scenarios, and can be useful for all.</p>

<div id="eun-theythem-2022-cohort" class="section level2">
<h2>Eun (they/them): 2022 Cohort</h2>
<p><b>What has being a RECRUIT meant to you?</b></p>
<p>The RECRUIT internship is important to me as a psychology major in
college and as an opportunity to help others in ways I searched for and
failed to find in my own times of need in the past.</p>
<p><b>Why did you choose the RECRUIT Internship?</b></p>
<p>The internship offered experience with working in the field of mental
health, and with THRIVE’s large focus on marginalized folks, I found
myself wanting to apply.</p>
<p><b>What would you tell potential RECRUIT applicants?</b></p>
<p>The people at THRIVE are incredibly supportive, understanding, and
provides meticulous training that makes you feel ready as a crisis
responder. If you want to help marginalized people in crisis or just in
need of a listening ear and are perhaps marginalized yourself, there is
great reward and personal growth in joining and working in the RECRUIT
internship.</p>
<p><b>What is your biggest takeaway as a RECRUIT?</b></p>
<p>I learned so much more about marginalized experiences through this
internship, better ways to navigate trauma, ways to ground people that
have proven to help others in real life, and so many more. I’ve also
learned time management, timeliness, and ways to communicate efficiently
in a team-focused environment.</p>

<p><img src="images/leslie1.jpeg" alt="headshot of brown woman sitting in car" style="float: right; width: 35%; height: 35%; padding: 30px"/></p>
<p><b>What has being a RECRUIT meant to you?</b></p>
<p>The THRIVE Lifeline RECRUIT internship is a valuable experience for
me because it allowed me to develop a good foundation for my future
endeavors. As a counseling student, I often found myself referring back
to what I learned in RECRUIT training and applying it to my philosophy
as a future counselor. I also feel that my experience at THRIVE Lifeline
is very fulfilling because it’s important to extend compassion towards
others during these difficult times and being a RECRUIT has allowed me
to do that.</p>
<p><b>Why did you choose the RECRUIT Internship?</b></p>
<p>I applied to the RECRUIT internship because I really resonated with
THRIVE Lifeline’s cause. As a POC and a member of the LGBTQ+ community,
it is imperative to address the struggles that others in our community
are facing and to give them a safe space. Mental health advocacy is also
something that I highly value, and I really liked that THRIVE Lifeline
prioritizes the mental health of texters and their crisis
responders.</p>
<p><b>What would you tell potential RECRUIT applicants?</b></p>
<p>I highly recommend others to apply for the RECRUIT internship. Being
a crisis responder allows you to give back to your community, which is
so rewarding. Being a RECRUIT also allows individuals to learn about
ways in which we can be supportive and empathetic towards texters and
the people in our own lives. In addition to the valuable skills that
individuals may obtain through training, the THRIVE Lifeline community
is so welcoming and kind.</p>
<p><b>What is your biggest takeaway as a RECRUIT?</b></p>
<p>One of the biggest things I’ve learned is that to be a part of a good
support system, the greatest thing we can do is be good listeners. As
crisis responders, we may feel obligated to solve other people’s
problems or give advice. But sometimes we just need to be present and
listen to our texters.</p>

<p><img src="images/leinani.jpg" alt="headshot of Hawaiian person with long hair, with a city in the background" style="float: left; width: 35%; height: 35%; padding: 30px"/></p>
<p><b>What has being a RECRUIT meant to you?</b></p>
<p>I’ve learned to address my own biases and be exposed to many diverse
individuals. My knowledge gained from training to help these individuals
and connect with them on our shared common ground allows me to support
them no matter what they are going through. I’ve learned how to work
with many different identities as well as a myriad of ways to support
texters. Whether that be texters seeking support, validation, a
safe-space, a non-judgmental listening ear, resources, or in imminent
crisis.</p>
<p><b>Why did you choose the RECRUIT Internship?</b></p>
<p>Having been rejected by society, I wanted to find a safe space where
I could be accepted as me and to create / hold that space for those who
reach out to THRIVE. Some days we need someone to help us give ourselves
permission to take up the space we deserve in this world–THRIVE does
this!</p>
<p><b>What is your biggest takeaway as a RECRUIT?</b></p>
<p>Being connected to THRIVE’s community and my mentor allows me to
develop individually and professionally. I have gained confidence in
myself, in my abilities, and as a leader. Academically, I’ve been able
to gain exposure and experience supporting people through mental health
crises while applying the knowledge I gained from my classes and THRIVE
training. Professionally, I am able to gain experience as I prepare my
grad school applications for obtaining my PsyD and helping serve
underserved populations.</p>
