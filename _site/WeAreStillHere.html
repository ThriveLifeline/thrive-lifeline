</div>


<p>Cy (he/they) is a RECRUIT Intern and the artist behind the We Are
Still Here project, which aimed to amplify the stories and voices of
humans that may otherwise go unheard. Cy collected personal narratives
from multiply marginalilzed people within our communities, and created
hand-drawn portraits depicting people as they wish to be seen.</p>

<p><img src="images/diem_wash.png" alt="drawn portrait of Indian person with short, dyed blue / green hair. Pan and trans flag colors are around them. They wear a dress shirt and have a confident look" style="float: right; width: 50%; height: 50%; padding: 30px"/></p>
<div id="diem-hethey" class="section level2">
<h2>Diem (he/they)</h2>
<p>Growing up, it was hard not to feel perpetually stuck in the middle.
Neither boy nor girl, neither gay nor straight, neither completely
Westernized nor Indian. I lamented being a floater in search of solid
ground within social groups. It was only a matter of time before the
differences were irreconcilable — either between me and the group, or
between me and the ‘me’ people thought me to be. I was either too close
to the stereotype or not stereotypical enough: too confident in my
queerness for Texas but not enough for Toronto.</p>
<p>I spent so long trying to figure out which box I fit into that I
neglected myself. The energy I put into making sure I didn’t alienate
myself from newspaper staffs, marching band members, classmates, and
extended family zapped me of the strength I needed to find myself in the
mess of my anxieties and others’ expectations. The worst part was that I
ended up feeling alienated anyway because you can’t feel cared for by
others if the person they are caring for is not ‘you’.</p>
<p>It was only when I fully embraced my queerness, my transness, and my
background that I felt able to form genuine connections. It was only
when I learned to reserve my energy for those who energize and support
me that I stopped always feeling alone. Of course, not everything is
solved, but I’m an Indian, queer trans guy medically transitioning with
the support of my family and friends — and I’m the happiest I’ve been in
years.</p>
<p><br></p>

</div>
<div id="colt-sheher" class="section level2">
<h2>Colt (she/her)</h2>
<p>My name is Colt. I’m a cis, ethnically Jewish sapphic queer woman,
and I detransitioned as trans person. I know detransitioning has
historically been stigmatized but I want to help change the narrative. I
believe we all deserve to be who we are and if that means exploring your
gender and/or sexuality, that is totally ok.</p>
<p>I grew up in the south, and I wasn’t getting the support I needed. I
had the privilege to travel all over the US to explore my truth. Now
that I’m in my 30’s, I feel happy and free.</p>

<h2>Delta (they/them)</h2>
<p>I’ve always felt like I was on the sidelines. I was a neurodivergent
child who did not fit in at school, and I first developed a chronic
illness at age 11. I first realized I was queer when I was 13. I
struggled to make friends, struggled to find any other child who could
possibly understand. But now I’m in college, and those things that once
made me an outcast and made me fear I’d never get through life
independently make me strong. They have given me community and have
allowed me to build community. I’m proud to be disabled, neurodivergent,
and queer. Not because those things make my life easy. But because of
the shared strength I have with my community.</p>

<div id="cyrus-hetheyany" class="section level2">
<h2>Cyrus (he/they/any)</h2>
<p>A stark white, serene, business-y virtual background. Blocking out
the ever-changing chaos, depression cave scenery that surrounds me. I
haven’t left my house alone in months. I’m too scared.</p>
<p>School was my escape, since graduating uni last year, work has become
my escape. And my lifeline. My structure. My source of income. My
success and my friends and family’s pride. I’ve gone corporate. Not very
Berkeley of me!</p>
<p>But we deserve to be everywhere. In conference rooms and board rooms
too. But I know who I am and what I need to be here.</p>
<p>I have gotten 2 new gender neutral bathrooms opened at my company in
my state. We went from 1 trucker bathroom in Shipping and Deliveries in
the basement to 3 gender neutral bathrooms in the state of California,
with blueprints being drawn for more in another office.</p>
<p>We should be able to be corporate. We should have access. One
bathroom in the state? Of California? Of the second largest tech company
in the world? Is unacceptable.</p>
<p>Queer, trans, nonbinary, mixed ethnicity, immigrant parents,
disowned, no financial support, physically disabled, neurodivergent,
abuse survivor, mental illnesses, takes meds. What box don’t I
check?</p>
<p>8 scholarships to get through college.</p>
<p>6 figure earner at 20 fresh out of college.</p>
<p>I beat the odds- and now I’m paving a trail for others to do the
same. Until it isn’t beating the odds, and success and access are our
norm.</p>

<h2>Kels (they/them)</h2>
<p>How do I fit my life in 300 words? Unprecedented summarizing! I am a
contradictory collection, swarming within scarred, tattooed skin:
genre-defying, multitude encompassing, unrelentingly verbose. I’ve never
been one to read a single book at a time / subscribe to binaries / fall
in love with just one person. I am, if anything, Queer, àla bell hooks:
“the self that is at odds with everything around it… that has to invent
and create and find a place to speak and to thrive and to live.” I am a
cycle-breaker, a survivor (of abusers aplenty, at many ages / stages; of
oppressive systems; of brushes with Death): expected, like so many of
us, to achieve endlessly, regardless, and to thank everyone for the
opportunity. I am an accumulation of formative experiences: growing up
neurodivergent / trans / gay in the Bible Belt, in a multifamily
household not unlike “Running with Scissors”, traumas masked by
privilege / test scores. Breaking down, running away at 15; the
following nightmarish year in residential “treatment” in Utah (enough to
cement a calling to “alchemize” what I’d lived through by later
supporting and advocating for the most vulnerable / naming such
corruptions). Even grown up, in long longed-for NYC, I cycled between
grad schools and hospitals: still so “treatment-resistant” that they
eventually tried almost 50 electric zaps to my broken brain in all
(<b>shockingly</b> electrocution didn’t cure me / mostly left me
forgetful, filterless). Last year, increasingly unbearable pain finally
culminated in a life-changing Official Diagnosis with an incurable
genetic disorder (hEDS)— only 33 years after the first symptoms! This
revelation of my long-denied host of illnesses has me processing /
raging / grieving the unfathomable impact of medical gaslighting and
neglect— all those accusations of hypochondria; malingering, even! It’s
been the heartbreaking end of several relationships and chapters of my
life: humbling, illuminating, freeing.</p>

<h2>Theo (they/them)</h2>
<p>I’m a non-binary transgender person, and the host of a DID system. We
also experience depression, anxiety, and complex PTSD. I used to feel
like I was too weird for anyone to ever really know me and still like
me. Gay, transgender, mentally ill, neurodivergent, multiple. “I just
get wierder as people get to know me!” I thought. “There’s no way anyone
will think I’m worth loving.” But now I have people in my life who
actually do love and accept me in all my complexity. They celebrate my
queerness, my resilience, my uniqueness. I still struggle with
depression and anxiety. I still feel lonely. I still experience chronic
suicidal ideation (which is common for people complex ptsd), but I know
that I don’t deserve to suffer. I know that I’m not hard to love. I am
good, and I am worthy of love. And so are you.</p>

<h2>The Galaxy (all pronouns)</h2>
<p>Collectively we are The Galaxy, a system of parts who make up a whole
mind. We have complex Dissociative Identity “Disorder” whose main
symptom is identity fragmentation; for us, this condition is our brain’s
adaptation to survive many forms of abuse and other traumas throughout
our life. Our body is mixed South American Native, and we exist as
genderqueer, multicultural, autistic, mad, and physically disabled
persons. We depend on our community for financial, emotional, and
physical support, and we are strong advocates for the importance of
building community care and support networks outside of oppressive
institutions. In order to survive, we have been forced to hide the
scarier truths of our mental and physical disabilities, such as
voice-hearing, self harm addiction, and chronic pain, which especially
in conjunction with our racial identity, can and have resulted in severe
danger. It is our prayer that one day, nobody should have to hide their
disabilities in order to survive, but instead can reveal their support
needs to a community where they will be protected.</p>

<p>I am a trans, neurodivergent and mad human studying to work in mental
health. Growing up I always felt othered, like my soul was defective and
broken and had been sent on this earth by accident, and that everybody
could feel it. I went through 9 years of intense bullying which led me
to struggle a lot during my teenage years. I got diagnosed with
dysthymia + MDD, GAD + panic disorder, anorexia, C-PTSD, and later with
BPD and alcohol use disorder, and struggled a lot with suicide.</p>
<p>During my stays in psychiatric wards, I witnessed many devoted
members of the staff who treated us like humans with compassion and
kindness, and I also witnessed situations where psychiatry was misused
to overly drug and restrain patients, and abuse that came from stigma
from the practitionners. That shaped my view on how we treat mad
individuals in this medical system, especially those from marginalised
communities and identities, and I want to do good. On the side apart
from my studies, I am learning more about anti-carceral and
community-led ways to help, focused on harm reduction, that I want to
integrate in my future work.</p>
<p>I am no longer ashamed of my queerness nor my madness. They are
integral parts of who I am that don’t need to be fixed.</p>

<p>Life hurts. I know it does. I know it does because I’ve been there.
There are times where I have questioned why, why this life had to be
given to me when I felt like a ghost inside. Why was I given this life
to live when I selfishly wish I wasn’t here in the first place. These
are questions that I have asked myself for years, and though I don’t
have an answer to any of them. I recognize that it’s okay to admit that
life hurts.</p>

<h2>Nathan (she/her)</h2>
<p>From the time I was really young, I knew I didn’t want to be a boy. I
constantly asked my family if they would love me if I were a girl and I
would play dress up and other typically girly games. Even though I had
always knew I didn’t want to be a boy, I really struggled with my
identity because I always thought I just had to be a boy since that’s
how I was raised and that’s what everyone knew me to be. I finally took
a big step in the journey that is my identity and came out as a trans
woman. I haven’t told many of my family because I feared that they
wouldn’t like me. I know that they would still love me, but I’ve heard
them talk negatively about other people’s identities and I’m scared they
would talk about me the same way and no longer think of me as their
family. Even though I still have a lot of growing to do, I know that I
will never let anyone tell me who I am or who they think I should
be.</p>
