_includes folder has a lot of important information:
    - header: the green banner on every page
    - image: how images are formatted
    - sidebar: the contact information that appears at the bottom of the index
    - footer: where the copyright is
    - navigation: how topnav functions, as well as naming the top left field

_data folder has the Top Nav menu

Add images to the images/ directory
Add syllabi to the syllabi/ directory

Links:
[thing](https://some-external-link.com)
[on the group page](group-page.html)
    Do NOT have a forward slash in the internal page paths!!!!!

To insert an image, update the variables in the brackets below:
{% include image.html file="name.ext" max-width="600" alt="Alt tag here"
caption="Helpful caption here" %}

The image settings already know to pull from the images folder, but if you
further separate that folder into subfolders, you'll need the subfolder
name in the file path.

.yml files are VERY particular about formatting, and if you try to adhere to the
80 character lines, you'll be upset.

New pages need to start with "front matter" separated out by 3 hyphens before
and after. Ex:
---
layout: default
title: "Core Skills"
permalink: /core-skills.html
---
