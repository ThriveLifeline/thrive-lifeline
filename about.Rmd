**T**hriving **H**arnesses **R**espect, **I**nclusion, and **V**ested
**E**mpathy: A crisis text line staffed by people in STEMM with marginalized
identities.

THRIVE Lifeline is a grassroots response to COVID-19, organized by experienced
crisis managers who personally understand the significance of displacement,
isolation, and financial loss, especially for people in STEMM with marginalized
identities.

The summer of 2020 was particularly tumultuous for minority students due to
a variety of reasons including, but not limited to: racist acts against
Asian-Americans; police brutality, protests, and national discussions of
systemic racism; removal of healthcare protections for transgender people,
and the devastating impact and associated uncertainties of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Amid a crisis of global scale, many marginalized individuals face greater
personal crises, including being sent to unsupportive and/or dangerous home
environments, greater health risks, job, food, and home insecurity, and the
inability to access what may be their only safe community.

## Who Are We?
THRIVE Lifeline is Trans-led and operated. We are a group of certified suicide
interventionists whose identities are marginalized, and who are students and
early career professionals trained across the breadth of STEMM fields.

<br>
Our backgrounds include familial rejection due to our identities, homelessness,
poverty, and working multiple jobs before being able to access and/or while
accessing education. Many of us are individuals who have navigated accommodations
processes during our academic journeys as a result of neurodivergence,
living with disabilities, and/or facing trauma.

## Mission
THRIVE Lifeline’s mission is to end stigma and close access gaps for
underrepresented individuals who seek educational and professional opportunities.
Particularly, we believe that equity and inclusion begins with person-centered
and whole-human support, including access to crisis intervention, validation,
and resources.

We fulfill our mission by:

* Providing texters with free 24/7 hotline support by trained, non-judgmental
Crisis Responders who share underrepresented identities and backgrounds.
* Reducing suicide risk through literature-based deescalation practices and by
connecting texters with life-saving and life-affirming resources.
* Using anonymized data to train leaders and advocate for representation in
more welcoming and inclusive educational and professional spaces.

## Vision
We envision academic and professional spaces that actively and equitably
include everyone, removing stigma and minimizing underrepresentation.

## Core Values

* Accessibility: THRIVE Lifeline remains 100% free to texters.
We believe that access to life-affirming and life-saving resources is crucial.
* Connection: Often, our texters are ‘the only one’ in their families, in their
departments, in their labs, in their classrooms.
When a texter reaches out to THRIVE Lifeline, they are not alone.
* Inclusion: Representation matters.
Being recognized at the core of who you are is the center of inclusion.
Whoever you are, wherever you are from, THRIVE welcomes you.
* Integrity: We uphold the highest standards of communications, support, and
confidentiality, knowing that the heart of our work involves people at their
most vulnerable times.
