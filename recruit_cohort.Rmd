## Emilio (they/them)

Emilio Valladolid is studying both Psychology and Sociology at San Diego State University. They do various intersectional work within their greater community including working with several nonprofits. Their passions include bridging inequities, such as disparities in sexual reproductive health, LGBTQ+ education, racial and disability justice and dismantling systems of oppression. They believe their lived experience as an individual within these marginalized communities helps them bring a valuable perspective to the table, while their passion to create safe, accessible, and inclusive support for all, drives their dedication to advocacy. Emilio’s favorite way to spend their time other than advocacy work, is with their sweet girlfriend Monique, their silly dog Simba, and their suave cat Smokey. They love spending time in any body of water and learning new facts about sharks and other marine life. They hope to spend their life always growing and discovering something beautiful everyday.

Hello! My name is Ren, and I’m a freshman at UC Berkeley. I plan on double majoring in political science and sociology, and I hope to graduate in three years. As a nonbinary immigrant, I’m a human rights activist and I believe that intersectionality should be a huge priority. In the future, whether I work in law or with an NGO, I hope to use my knowledge and experiences from the THRIVE RECRUIT program to bring inclusion and empathy to my career and community. Outside of school and activism, my favorite hobbies are gardening, baking, and piano. I’m an avid reader and I enjoy thrifting second-hand books. I’m very social and I love meeting new people! I’m super excited to work with THRIVE, and I look forward to being able to give back to my community.

Jordy Kazeze is a 21 year old college student near the Chicagoland area. They are studying psychology with a minor in business innovation & entrepreneurship and will be graduating with their bachelors degree in December! They’re excited to join the internship because they love working in places where they can help people; actively use their knowledge, skills, and abilities; and not feel like they have to compromise their many marginalized identities. In their free time, they love playing with animals, watching their favorite YouTube creators, anime, and cartoons, reading comics and manga, and being around other people. They can’t wait to join the THRIVE RECRUIT team and meet other like-minded individuals with similar experiences while working on a mission they believe in!
