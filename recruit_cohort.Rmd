Thanks to a grant from Dow through the company’s All <i>IN</i> ERG fund\*, we are so deeply excited and honored to to announce our first paid RECRUIT Intern cohort and begin working with them this school year!

\*Dow's ALL <i>IN</i> ERG Fund is a grant program that empowers the Company's Employee Resource Groups to address local community diversity, inclusion, and equity needs. Read the full press release [here](https://thrivelifeline.org/recruit_grant.html).

RECRUIT interns are provided with one full year of in depth training and mentorship alongside skills practice in crisis response for marginalized communities, community education and outreach, and leadership of people with multiply marginalized identities. They will work with us for an average of 6 hours per week for 50 weeks, giving them the ability to manage other jobs, school, and caregiving activities that are common in multiply marginalized communities. Our remote internship with flexible hours supports students facing a variety of barriers to paid opportunities. Our RECRUIT cohort will be with us from August 2023 - August 2024, and we couldn't be more excited!

Learn about each of our RECRUIT interns, their professional goals and dreams, and their hobbies, below!

Jordy Kazeze is a 21 year old college student near the Chicagoland area. They are studying psychology with a minor in business innovation & entrepreneurship and will be graduating with their bachelors degree this year!

In their free time, they love playing with animals, watching their favorite YouTube creators, anime, and cartoons, reading comics and manga, and being around other people. They can’t wait to join the THRIVE RECRUIT team and meet other like-minded individuals with similar experiences while working on a mission they believe in!

Emilio Valladolid is studying both Psychology and Sociology at San Diego State University. They do various intersectional work within their greater community including working with several nonprofits. Their passions include bridging inequities, such as disparities in sexual reproductive health, LGBTQ+ education, racial and disability justice and dismantling systems of oppression. They believe their lived experience as an individual within these marginalized communities helps them bring a valuable perspective to the table, while their passion to create safe, accessible, and inclusive support for all, drives their dedication to advocacy. Emilio’s favorite way to spend their time other than advocacy work, is with their sweet girlfriend Monique, their silly dog Simba, and their suave cat Smokey. They love spending time in any body of water and learning new facts about sharks and other marine life. They hope to spend their life always growing and discovering something beautiful everyday.
