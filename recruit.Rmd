\* We dream of building a team that is representative of the breadth of our communities. We encourage applications from underrepresented LGBTQ2S+ persons of color, persons living with disabilities, Two Spirit, trans-femme and/or femme nonbinary individuals, and/or veterans. Additionally, we pride ourselves in working with people who struggle to gain traditional internships, whether that be because you are in a rural area, do not have transportation, are unable to find affirming support for your identity, working multiple jobs, caregiving, or any other barriers you might have faced. THRIVE’s team is majority POC and LGBTQ2S+ and we deeply value increasing representation.

Thanks to a grant from Dow through the company's All <i>IN</i> ERG fund\*, we are excited to announce <b>5 paid internship positions</b>\** for a 12 month internship that will run <u>August 20, 2023 - August 17, 2024</u>. Applications for these positions will close on <b>May 26, 2023</b> and we will retain a waitlist as candidates are chosen. 

\*Dow's ALL <i>IN</i> ERG Fund is a grant program that empowers the Company's Employee Resource Groups to address local community diversity, inclusion, and equity needs. Read the full press release [here](https://thrivelifeline.org/recruit_grant.html).

\**Please note that while funding is limited to 5 paid positions, space may open for volunteer-based internships (180 hours rather than 300) as our resources allow. We welcome your continued interest if volunteering is an option for you and we will continue to communicate when space becomes available. Please email  <info@thrivelifeline.org> to be added to the waitlist.
