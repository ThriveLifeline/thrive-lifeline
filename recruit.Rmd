THRIVE’s RECRUIT internship program centers undergraduate students whose 
identities are marginalized.

\* We dream of building a team that is representative of the breadth of our communities. We encourage applications from underrepresented LGBTQ2S+ persons of color, persons living with disabilities, Two Spirit, trans-femme and/or femme nonbinary individuals, and/or veterans. Additionally, we pride ourselves in working with people who struggle to gain traditional internships, whether that be because you are in a rural area, do not have transportation, are unable to find affirming support for your identity, working multiple jobs, caregiving, or any other barriers you might have faced. THRIVE’s team is majority POC and LGBTQ2S+ and we deeply value increasing representation.

Our RECRUITs work remotely and internationally. If you have questions about whether we can host your internship, please let us know!

**We are not currently offering paid internships.

## Program

The THRIVE RECRUIT Internship combines significant training, mentorship, and applied skills development in a flexible number of hours per week. This volunteer-based internship is designed to meet the varying needs of undergraduate students in our communities by 

- Being customizable to your specific needs,
- Being adjustable between 200 and 400 total hours,
- Being adjustable between one semester and one year in length,
  - Please note that THRIVE believes in your training, counts your training hours into your customized RECRUIT program, and invests a $6000 value in personally training and mentoring each RECRUIT. However, due to its nature, our training is emotionally laborious and intense. We typically recommend that students take a training option which is 10 - 12 weeks long at 5 - 6 hours per week, meaning that for most people who want to complete their internship skills in a single semester, it is advisable to complete training with us the semester before you begin your skills practice as a Crisis Responder on THRIVE Lifeline.
- Being flexible to your need to balance your studies, jobs, and family / community roles while completing this program, and
- Lending our experience to help you to develop, maintain, and articulate your skills to your college or university as well as your future graduate programs, employers, and/or volunteer supervisors.
As a RECRUIT, you join a collaborative community of volunteers committed to serving our communities.

THRIVE’s unique training is centered in Whole-Human, empathetic support, cross-identity affirmation, and trauma-informed communication.
When you are onboarded, you will be paired with a mentor who will work directly with you throughout your training period. 

*Please let us know if your degree program has specific requirements for*
*your mentor.*

*Please note that crisis response shifts must be scheduled during our busiest hours – this allows you to get the most experience and opportunities to support texters, and also supports THRIVE the most.
