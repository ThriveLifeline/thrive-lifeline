## About THRIVE

**T**hriving **H**arnesses **R**espect, **I**nclusion, and **V**ested
**E**mpathy: A crisis text line staffed by marginalized individuals in STEM.

THRIVE Lifeline is a grassroots response to COVID-19, organized by experienced
crisis managers who personally understand the significance of displacement,
isolation, and financial loss, especially for marginalized individuals in STEM.

The events of 2020 caused large-scale collective and ongoing trauma, bringing
to the public dialogue the need for self care and mental wellness.

Amid a crisis of global scale, many marginalized individuals face greater
personal crises, including being sent to unsupportive and/or dangerous home
environments, greater health risks, job, food, and home insecurity, and the
inability to access what may be their only safe community.

Recognizing the particular vulnerabilities within our intersecting communities
and the breadth of needs, we used our existing crisis team to open a
small-scale crisis hotline.
THRIVE Lifeline began as a grassroots crisis text line targeting marginalized
people in STEM, or STEM-adjacent, and remains
accessible to all who need it.

Within three months, our team became convinced that we must scale up and
sustain this crisis hotline resource and partner with other entities and
individuals in STEM as we partner together to improve mental health access and
support in STEM.
In June 2020, we officially registered T.H.R.I.V.E., Inc., a nonprofit
organization dedicated to the management of THRIVE Lifeline as well as to
training, consultation, and event accessibility and crisis management services.

### We believe that it is together that we THRIVE.


We need your help in order to keep THRIVE Lifeline as a vital resource!
You can help by **volunteering, contributing**, and **sharing**.

- **Volunteer**: No prior experience is necessary. We are looking for active
listeners with a passion for underrepresented individuals and a willingness to
learn.
We are especially seeking responders who are **persons of color, persons living
with disabilities, and/or transgender/nonbinary individuals**.
If crisis response is not a good fit, we are additionally seeking:
   - Resource Manager: This volunteer will manage the vetting and addition of
   new resources to our database.
   - Outreach Assistant: This volunteer will assist with outreach, sharing
   THRIVE Lifeline as a resource and broadening the impact of the hotline.
   - Training Assistant: This volunteer will support our Crisis Responders in
   Training (CRiT) by acting as texters to the hotline and conducting practice
   text-based interactions at appointed times (within the Assistant's scheduled
   availability).
   The volunteer will be given one scripted scenario, along with its desired
   CRiT learning outcomes. A practice interaction will be approximately 40-60 min.
   *While you are free to use sample responses as long as they flow in the
   conversations, please be advised that improvisation and adjustments will be
   required, based on a CRiT's responses to your role-played texter's statements.*
   - Web Media Manager: This volunteer will manage THRIVES social media presence.
