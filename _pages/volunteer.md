We have the following volunteer positions available:
   - Resource Manager: This volunteer will manage the vetting and addition of new resources to our database. 
   - Outreach Assistant: This volunteer will assist with outreach, sharing THRIVE Lifeline as a resource and broadening the impact of the hotline. 
   - Training Assistant: This volunteer will support our Crisis Responders in Training (CRiT) by acting as texters to the hotline and conducting practice text-based interactions at appointed times (within the Assistant's scheduled availability). The volunteer will be given one scripted scenario, along with its desired CRiT learning outcomes. A practice interaction will be approximately 40-60 min.*While you are free to use sample responses as long as they flow in the conversations, please be advised that improvisation and adjustments will be required, based on a CRiT's responses to your role-played texter's statements. 
   - Web Media Manager: This volunteer will manage THRIVES social media presence.
