<font size="+2">Workshop 1: A Lived Experience Perspective on Eating Disorders</font>

A panel discussion on lived experience with eating disorders (EDs) and their intersections with trauma, neurodivergence, fatness, race and ethnicity, gender identity, and disability. We’ll explore the reality of living with an ED (including lesser discussed EDs such as ARFID), and the ways that EDs can be both functional as well as harmful, especially considered with a harm reduction framework. Learn various experiences of helpful versus harmful support approaches, tips for navigating your own EDs, and how to better show up for people in your lives who have EDs, all while centering autonomy and humanity. 

<b>Date:</b> Sunday, September 22 at 8pm GMT / 4pm ET / 10am HT; 1.5 hours 

<br>

<font size="+2">Workshop 2: A Lived Experience Perspective on OCD</font>

A panel discussion exploring lived experience with OCD as something much more complex and disruptive than simply having a fixation on cleanliness or counting things. We’ll talk about ways that OCD intersects with panelists’ trauma, queer identities, chronic conditions, disabilities, and/or other neurodivergencies like autism, tic disorders, and body-focused repetitive behaviors. We’ll discuss how these intersecting experiences can complicate seeking support or treatment, as well as how it impacts day-to-day life. Gain tips from our panelists on how to receive and/or provide support that is truly helpful. Learn their experiences with approaches that were harmful for them. Ask honest questions and receive resources that you can implement into your daily lives!

<b>Date:</b> Sunday, September 29 at 8pm GMT / 4pm ET / 10am HT; 1.5 hours
