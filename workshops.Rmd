<br>

<font size="+2"><b>Workshop 1.</b> Creating Safer Spaces for Plural People </font>

Plural people are often robbed of safety when supporters do not understand plurality and/or act in ways that increase stigma and trauma responses. Attend this workshop to learn more about the dangers faced by Plural people and those in dissociative communities. Understand from a lived-experience and non-carceral lens what is required for safer spaces.

Supporters: Learn the needs of those you’re supporting and how to uphold safer spaces for people in dissociative communities.

People with lived experience: Equip yourselves to create and/or thrive within community spaces that are by and for Plural people.

This interactive workshop will deepen your practice through discussions and relevant case scenarios!

<b>Date:</b> Sunday, March 9 at 2pm ET / 11am PT; 2 hours 

<br>

<font size="+2"><b>Workshop 2.</b> Supporting Plural People During Crises </font>

Grossly few supporters are trained for Plural-affirming crisis support, which can increase the risk of escalation and harm or death when Plural people face crises. This workshop will dive into the complexities of crises in dissociative communities and examine the forms of traditional crisis support that can be harmful. We will teach non-carceral approaches and community care from a lived-experience and trauma-informed lens. Learn if intervention is warranted and how to support the agency and autonomy of system members. Practice the skills we teach through guided case studies and learn how to adapt quickly when required.

<b>Date:</b> Sunday, March 16 at 2pm ET / 11am PT; 2 hours
