If you’re experiencing a mental health crisis and need to chat with a qualified
crisis responder, we are here for you.

If you are an underrepresented individual (person of color, LGBTQIA+, person
living with disabilities, and/or other marginalized identities), and
experiencing obstacles because of (or simply have questions about) your
identity, we want to help you navigate those.

<br>

Please text "THRIVE" to begin your conversation with us 24/7/365, from anywhere:
<a href="sms:+13136628209&body=THRIVE">+1.313.662.8209</a>

<br>

We are experienced suicide interveners who will help keep you safe during times
of acute mental health crises. If you are not in an acute crisis, but are
dealing with stress as you navigate identity, orientation, or barriers to
academic and professional entry, we can help! We are here to support your
whole-self and we’re happy to help you during these troubling times.

THRIVE Lifeline offers 24/7 judgment-free, confidential text messaging to
individuals aged 18+.
