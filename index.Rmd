If you’re experiencing a mental health crisis and need to chat with a qualified
crisis responder, we are here for you.

If you are an underrepresented individual (person of color, LGBTQ2S+, person
living with disabilities, neurodivergent, and/or other marginalized identities), 
and experiencing obstacles because of (or simply have questions about) your
identities, we want to help you navigate those.

<center>

<img src="images/6_week_intensive.png" alt="Dark green background with shadows and large white text reading Stubborn Survivors Chronic Suicidality Narrative Reclamation 6-Week Intensive. Starting in July! Sliding scale pricing available, see details. A non-carceral, depathologized intensive program designed by and for people who navigate chronic suicidality"
style="width: 75%; height: 75%"/>

</center>

An intensive program for suicidality that isn’t carceral?? Correct! This is an intimate cohort-based program with daily mixes of group coaching, personalized and community care, and synchronous and asynchronous coaching elements. Participants will gain insight, support, and step-by-step tools that help you to reclaim your suicide narrative in ways that are meaningful to you!

No more losing your agency when you disclose suicidality to someone who isn’t safe, being pathologized, facing increased trauma when you needed care, not being believed, having to prove yourself, or feeling trapped. We've partnered with Stronger U on this program for YOU. We want to help you reclaim your narrative because it matters. You matter.

[Click here to register for the 6-week program](https://form.jotform.com/251036811552147). Or, [learn more here](https://strongeruwellness.com/6-week-intensive/).
