## Quinn (he/him): Current RECRUIT Intern

<b>Why does the RECRUIT internship matter to you?</b>

"It's been difficult to find ways to get practical experience in college since COVID-19 started. The RECRUIT internship matters to me because it gave me a way to get involved and get experience in a field that doesn't have a lot of undergraduate opportunities. The RECRUIT internship has also introduced me to such a wonderful and supportive community that I'm grateful to be a part of. Everyone on the team brings valuable and diverse sets of knowledge that make us stronger."

<b>What made you want to apply for the RECRUIT internship?</b>

"I was ecstatic to hear about the opportunity to be involved with THRIVE.  It was truly a no-brainer for me to apply for the RECRUIT internship. I've had my fair share of negative experiences with crisis lines in the past. A lot of the lines that I've reached out to were ill-equipped to support my trans identity and I felt that I couldn't share about everything that I was going through in fear that they would call emergency services on me. One of the main reasons that I decided to apply for the RECRUIT internship with THRIVE was because of the no-escalation policy. Another reason that I decided to apply was that THRIVE truly values and demonstrates that they support diversity and inclusion."

<b>Why would you suggest someone else apply for the RECRUIT internship?</b>

"I've been involved with a lot of volunteer and extracurricular work during my college career. These experiences have provided me with numerous skills that have helped me excel in other areas of my life. However, my RECRUIT internship at THRIVE has given me, by far, the most rewarding experiences that I ever could have asked for. I feel immensely fulfilled knowing that I am contributing to giving back to my community and creating a better world for people to live in. I've also gained leadership, communication, teamwork, and empathy-building skills through the RECRUIT internship."

<b>What is the biggest thing you have learned / biggest way you have been impacted from the internship?</b>

"Being LGBTQ+ and a college student in the midst of COVID-19 has been a very isolating experience. But my internship at THRIVE has shown me that we are never truly alone in this world. I cannot understate the amount of support that I have gotten since I started my internship. I have felt supported at every step of the way. My mentor has been a truly inspirational figure in my life and I'm so grateful for the other leaders at THRIVE who have guided me through tough moments. It's really rewarding to know that you're molding a space where others don't have to fight as hard to stay alive and feel respected."

<b>Why does the RECRUIT internship matter to you?</b>

"The THRIVE Lifeline RECRUIT internship is a valuable experience for me because it allowed me to develop a good foundation for my future endeavors. As a counseling student, I often found myself referring back to what I learned in RECRUIT training and applying it to my philosophy as a future counselor. I also feel that my experience at THRIVE Lifeline is very fulfilling because it’s important to extend compassion towards others during these difficult and being a RECRUIT has allowed me to do that."

<b>What made you want to apply for the RECRUIT internship?</b>

"I applied to the RECRUIT internship because I really resonated with THRIVE Lifeline’s cause. As a POC and a member of the LGBTQ+ community, it is imperative to address the struggles that others in our community are facing and to give them a safe space. Mental health advocacy is also something that I highly value, and I really liked that THRIVE Lifeline prioritizes the mental health of texters and their crisis responders."

<b>Why would you suggest someone else apply for the RECRUIT internship?</b>

"I highly recommend others to apply for the RECRUIT internship. Being a crisis responder allows you to give back to your community, which is so rewarding. Being a RECRUIT also allows individuals to learn about ways in which we can be supportive and empathetic towards texters and the people in our own lives. In addition to the valuable skills that individuals may obtain through training, the THRIVE Lifeline community is so welcoming and kind."

<b>What is the biggest thing you have learned / biggest way you have been impacted from the internship?</b>

"One of the biggest things I’ve learned is that to be a part of a good support system, the greatest thing we can do is be good listeners. As crisis responders, we may feel obligated to solve other people’s problems or give advice. But sometimes we just need to be present and listen to our texters."
