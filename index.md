# Welcome to THRIVE


If you’re experiencing a mental health crisis and need to chat with a qualified crisis responder, we are here for you.

If you are an underrepresented individual (person of color, LGBTQIA+, person living with disabilities, or other marginalized identities), 
and experiencing obstacles because of, or simply have questions about, your identity, we can help you navigate those.

<br/>

Please text us anytime, from anywhere at: 
# <a href="tel:+13136628209">+1(313)662-8209</a>



<br/>

We are experienced suicide interveners who will help keep you safe during times of acute mental health crises. If you are not in an acute crisis, but are dealing with stress as you navigate identity, orientation, or barriers to academic and professional entry, we can help! We are here to support your whole-self and we’re happy to help you during these troubling times. 

THRIVE Lifeline offers 24/7 judgement-free, confidential text messaging to individuals aged 18+.
