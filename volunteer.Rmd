Join the THRIVE Team! We are looking to train our next cohort of volunteers.

Requirements:

* 18+ years old
* Identify as an underrepresented individual
* Willingness to complete 30 hours of training within 6 weeks, a 3-hour
on-call shift per week, and 1-year commitment (Crisis Responders)
* Willingness to complete 4 hours of training and an average of 3-5 hours per
week (all other volunteers)
* Willingness to listen non-judgmentally to those in crisis

Note: No prior experience is necessary. We promise mentoring all along the way,
as well as high quality, empathetic training, and team collaboration.

* Our training is centered in Whole-Human, empathetic support, cross-identity
affirmation, trauma-informed care, and skillful deescalation
* Volunteers can work from any location: all that is required is a computer
with reliable internet and a private space.
* We are especially seeking responders who are **persons of color, persons
living with disabilities, Two Spirit, trans-femme and/or femme nonbinary
individuals, and/or veterans.**

<br/>
We have the following volunteer positions available:

   * Resource Manager: This volunteer will manage the vetting and addition of
   new resources to our database.
   * Outreach Assistant: This volunteer will assist with outreach, sharing
   THRIVE Lifeline as a resource and broadening the impact of the hotline.
   * Training Assistant: This volunteer will support our Crisis Responders in
   Training (CRiT) by acting as texters to the hotline and conducting practice
   text-based interactions at appointed times (within the Assistant's scheduled
   availability). The volunteer will be given one scripted scenario, along with
   its desired CRiT learning outcomes. A practice interaction will be
   approximately 40-60 min.
      + While you are free to use sample responses as long as they flow in the 
      conversations, please be advised that improvisation and adjustments will 
      be required, based on a CRiT's responses to your role-played texter's statements.
   * Web Media Manager: This volunteer will manage THRIVES social media presence.
