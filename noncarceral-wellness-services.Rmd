THRIVE Lifeline is a fully volunteer-led organization. We make our work sustainable by focusing our volunteer services on the provision of our lifeline and free community resources. For people who are interested in non-carceral services besides our lifeline, THRIVE partners with [Stronger U](https://strongeruwellness.com/) through a revenue sharing model. Stronger U provides THRIVE with funds, free volunteer training, and free community peer support options. If you are looking for customized paid services, Stronger U also offers a  discount to our greater THRIVE communities. Stronger U provides a variety of non-carceral-based workshops, educational resources, group and individual mental wellness coaching, in-person peer mental health support, and a variety of other full-service organizational projects. Contact <info@strongeruwellness.com> and mention THRIVE for more information.
